features:
  - |
    Add ``mistral_api_use_uwsgi`` which allows running mistral-api service
    without uWSGI (set to `true` by default).
upgrade:
  - |
    Along with ``mistral_api_use_uwsgi``, ``cron_trigger.enabled`` would be
    set to `false` by default, disabling Cron Triggers on all existing
    installations as per `suggestion <https://review.opendev.org/c/openstack/mistral/+/512520>`_.
fixes:
  - |
    Mistral Cron Triggers do not create Workflow Executions, when mistral-api
    service runs within uWSGI, so we introduce ``mistral_api_use_uwsgi``
    which bounds Cron Trigger service status with Mistral API execution
    environment.
